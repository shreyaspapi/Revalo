# ✅ sGHO APY IS NOW FIXED!

## What Changed

**Before:** APY showed as "N/A" ❌
**After:** APY shows as "5.85%" ✅

## The Solution

Your app now uses a **configurable APY value** because:
- sGHO is a separate staking mechanism (not a lending position)
- The Aave API doesn't expose sGHO staking APY
- GHO lending reserve has 0% APY (can't earn by supplying GHO)

## Test It

Run this command:
```bash
node test-sgho-final-solution.js
```

You'll see:
```
✅ sGHO Data (as your app will show):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Balance:   12606.70 sGHO
   USD Value: $12606.70
   APY:       5.85%  ← FIXED!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## How to Update APY

**File:** `src/lib/aave/sGhoConfig.ts`

```typescript
export const SGHO_APY = '5.85';  // ← Change this value
```

**When:** Weekly (recommended)
**Where to check:** https://app.aave.com/

## Files Changed

✅ **Created:**
- `src/lib/aave/sGhoConfig.ts` - APY configuration

✅ **Updated:**
- `src/lib/aave/sGhoService.ts` - Now uses config
- `src/lib/aave/index.ts` - Exports config

✅ **Tests:**
- `test-sgho-final-solution.js` - Verify it works
- `test-sgho-working.js` - Balance test

## Your App Now Shows

```typescript
// Real-time data from Aave API:
Balance:   12606.70 sGHO
USD Value: $12606.70

// From config file:
APY:       5.85%
```
